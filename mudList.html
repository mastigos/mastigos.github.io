      MMORPG) based on the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett. On Discworld you
      will meet many of the characters from those books. Terry's books are
      humorous fantasy and the game retains the comical, fun feel of the books.

      for player interaction: diverse areas totalling over a million rooms, the
      opportunity to become a member of one of 6 guilds, a citizen of one of the
      many city-states on the Disc, run your own shop, own your own house, write
      for the local newspaper, and much more!
